This repository contains code for building a SMS classifier using machine learning techniques in Python along with data analytics processes. The classifier is designed to categorize SMS messages into predefined categories, providing a practical solution for text classification tasks.

Overview
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. In this project, we aim to classify SMS messages into different categories such as spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning algorithms. The project includes the following components:

1.Data Collection: The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is collected from various sources containing labeled SMS messages..
2.Data Preprocessing: Raw text data is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, punctuation, and stop words. Text normalization techniques like stemming or lemmatization may also be applied.
3.Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data to represent each SMS message numerically. Common techniques include Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and word embeddings.
4.Model Training: Machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or Random Forest are trained on the extracted features to learn the patterns in the data and classify SMS messages.
5.Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset to assess their effectiveness in classifying SMS messages.
6.Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed into production to classify new incoming SMS messages in real-time.
